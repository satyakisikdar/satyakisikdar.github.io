Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Indiana University, Bloomington where I work with [Dr. Santo Fortunato](https://www.santofortunato.net) to explore citation and collaboration networks to better understand the scientific enterprise.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in Sep 2021 from the [University of Notre Dame](https://nd.edu) where I was advised by [Dr. Tim Weninger](https://timweninger.com). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Heritage Institute of Technology](https://heritageit.edu/) in Kolkata, India.

My core research interest is understanding the fundamental mechanisms and processes that govern complex, interconnected systems using tools at the confluence of *network science*, *machine learning*, and *computational social science*.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
